<!-- This WebAudioXML-document describes a virtual mixing console. The root-element

		<!-- This is a Chain element in a mixer. It works similar to a standard mixer-channel
		with the signal passing through a number of insert effects. This Chain hasn't got any
		insert effect. There are two attributes specified - "id" and "gain". Id is used for
		connecting incomming signals (i.e. from iMusic) to this Chain and gain acts as the
		channel volume slider. Gain can be specified with power values (between 0 - 1) or
		decibels. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel -->

		<!-- This channel as one insert-effect: a lowpass filter with the cutoff frequency
		set to 300Hz. Read more about the BiquadFilterNode:
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode) -->
		<Chain id="ch2" gain="-3dB">
			<BiquadFilterNode type="highpass" frequency="300"></BiquadFilterNode>
		</Chain>

		<!-- This Chain has its gain set to -6dB which reduces the volume of
		sounds playing through this channel -->
		<Chain id="ch3" gain="-6dB"></Chain>

		<!-- This Chain is a bit more complex. It contains the following elements:

		BiquadFilterNode:
		Similar to the Chain above

		StereoPannerNode:
		Controls the pan between left and right audio channel. This setup maps the variable
		"gameLevel.character.x" to control the pan value between -1 to +1 depending on the
		x-position of the character between 200 and 700 pixels.
		(Read more about mapping parameters: https://github.com/hanslindetorp/WebAudioXML/wiki/Parameters)

		Send:
		The last object in the Chain is a send-element. It splits the signal and sends one dry signal to the
		master output of the Mixer plus sends a signal to a reverb bus channel using the "output"-attribute.

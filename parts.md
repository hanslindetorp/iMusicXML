## Parts

A track can consist of any number of parts. There are some advantages using several shorter parts on a track compared to a long single part:

* Reuse an audio file in several parts to save memory and download time
* Make seamless transitions for instruments with transients and audio tails i.e. drums
* Make random patterns using Parts and [Random features](random.md)



A part is one bar by default one bar long but this can be changed with set("barLength")

# iMusic
An XML-syntax and parser for implementing adaptive music in HTML pages. It lets you arrange, loop, randomize and playback any number of sections, stems and Motifs in perfect sync. iMusic is built upon Web Audio API and is developed by Hans Lindetorp in an iterative process with students at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. 
All rights belongs to Hans Lindetorp. Feel free to use it. The code will change a lot during the coming years and will serve as a platform for studies related to music production in interactive media.

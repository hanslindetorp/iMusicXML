### Step 6:
Create Motifs. Typically short phrases expected to be triggered in musical time. By setting ”quantize”, you can define how the phrase is triggered:

```javascript
iMusic.set("quantize", "1/4"); // triggers the Motif on the next quarter note
iMusic.addMotif("motif1");
iMusic.addMotif("motif2");
iMusic.addMotif("motif3");
```

### Step 7:
Create LeadIns. Typically phrases/fill ins/sounds leading up to the next bar. I.e. by setting ”quantize” to the same value as the time signature and ”upbeat” to half the time signature, the phrase will be placed to play before the next barline. Note: The audio file needs to be exported with the starting point exactly at that point (i.e. 2 beats before the barline) and it’s often a good idea to include an audio tail after the barline.

i.e.
```javascript
iMusic.set("quantize", "4/4");
iMusic.set("upbeat", "2/4");
iMusic.addLeadIn("leadin");
```

To take advantage of this feature, you might find it useful to create a LeadIn with different files for different length of the upbeat:

i.e.
```javascript
iMusic.set("quantize", "4/4");
iMusic.addLeadIn([
	{upbeat: "1/4", url: "leadin_1-4"},
	{upbeat: "2/4", url: "leadin_2-4"},
	{upbeat: "3/4", url: "leadin_3-4"}
]);
```

### Step 8
Now it's time to make calls to iMusic to define WHEN a specific LoopTrack, Motif or LeadIn should play. You refer to the music by adressing them with their full name (without suffix):

```javascript
function init(){
    iMusic.play("tgA_tr1");
}
```

or ONE part of the name:
```javascript
function init(){
    iMusic.play("tr1");
}
```

If you trigger a Motif or LeadIn with several audio files (like the LeadIn-example above), ONE of the files will be triggered depending on the settings for upbeat and the time remaining to the position defined by quantize.


```javascript
function init(){
    iMusic.play("leadin");
}
```
